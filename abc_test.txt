Hello, I've seen plenty of posts on how to write to a file, or how to read from a file, but not any on how to read from one file and then write to another. Here I'm trying to read from one file, make all the letters caps, and then write to another. Any help would be appreciated. Both of the files have been created. The change from lower to uppercase does work. Later on I'll have the program do additional changes. 4in.txt is the declaration of independence. p4out1.txt is blank. They are in their proper directories as required for visual studio 2012. The program seems to do everything I want it to do so far except for writing to p4out1.txt. I run the program and the only output in p4out1.txt is 'ÿ'.shahriar
